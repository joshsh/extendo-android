Welcome to smsn-android, aka the Brainstem.

This is a no-frills Android app for connecting [SmSn](http://github.com/synchrony/smsn) Bluetooth devices (Typeatron, Extend-o-Hand) with an Extend-o-Brain knowledge base and event handlers.  If you have a Typeatron in your pocket, or you are planning to, you're in the right place.
SmSn-Android also contains a graphical [Flashcards](https://github.com/joshsh/flashcards) interface which will probably become a separate app in future.

To download SmSn Android 1.1-SNAPSHOT, click or scan:
