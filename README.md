Welcome to extendo-android, aka the Brainstem.

This is a no-frills Android app for connecting [Extendo](http://github.com/joshsh/extendo) Bluetooth devices (Typeatron, Extend-o-Hand) with an Extend-o-Brain knowledge base and event handlers.  If you have a Typeatron burning a hole in your pocket, you're in the right place.
Extendo-Android also contains a graphical [Flashcards](https://github.com/joshsh/flashcards) interface which will probably become a separate app in future.
